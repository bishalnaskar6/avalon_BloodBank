# avalon_BloodBank
A platform which allows user to collaborate with hospitals and make blood transfers more efficiently through our android app.
Nowadays it’s become easy to find a blood bank in a hospital, but in our point of view we are in the 21st century, we are living in a digital world and the medical sector is progressing at a rapid speedbut in terms of blood bank system I think we are still lagging behind.

Because it’s not fully digitalized and there’s a need for progress for the betterment of society.

So what’s our idea is we make the blood bank system to a new height and move it into a digital world.
It is a project which I have build in a hackathon while working with other team members.
Basically blood bank is a project which takes blood management into a digital world.
In this project we build an android application which consist of two different panel 
1) user:- In this user can upload the need of blood meassage.
2) hospital:- who will fulfill the need of blood.
